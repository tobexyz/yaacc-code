## Issue #252: Sort by Date / Recently Added for UPnP folders

Shipped in two specs on this branch, both fully built, reviewed, and
security-reviewed (final verdict PASS on both gates for both specs; one
or two early review cycles FAILed and were fixed before merge, per the
loop's own rules). Full planning history (requirements/design/tasks/
decisions/review cycles, ~3400 lines) removed after shipping — this is
the compact record. Git history has the rest if ever needed.

### Client-side sort (yaacc browsing a remote DLNA/UPnP server)

Files: `ContentListFragment`, `BrowseContentItemAdapter`,
`BrowseItemLoadTask` (`yaacc/src/main/java/de/yaacc/browser/`).

- Header toggle (Name/Date) next to the folder path, each with its own
  remembered direction (persisted via `SharedPreferences`, applied on
  app restart and across folders).
- Sends `SortCriterion` (`-dc:date`/`+dc:date`/`dc:title`) through
  `UpnpClient.browseSync(...)` → `Browse`'s `orderBy` first, so a
  compliant server returns pre-sorted results. Falls back to a
  client-side sort once the whole folder has loaded (no mid-load
  reshuffle).
- If a server **rejects** `SortCriteria` outright (a UPnP action
  failure), the app retries the same request unsorted instead of
  showing an empty folder, and remembers the rejection for the rest of
  that folder's chunked load.
- "Date" is disabled per-folder when nothing loaded so far has a
  `dc:date` value — no offering a no-op sort.
- Name mode keeps folders listed before items; Date mode fully
  interleaves containers and items by date.

### Server-side sort (yaacc's own embedded UPnP server honoring other clients' sort requests)

Files: `YaaccContentDirectory`, `SortSupport`, and the 20
`*FolderBrowser`/`*ItemBrowser` classes
(`yaacc/src/main/java/de/yaacc/upnp/server/contentdirectory/`).

- `GetSortCapabilities` now advertises `dc:title,dc:date` instead of an
  empty list, and `Browse` requests with a valid `SortCriteria` for
  either property actually determine result order (previously silently
  ignored, always returning each browser's hardcoded default order).
- `SortSupport` is the shared, pure-JDK (no `android.*` imports, unit
  testable on plain JVM) utility: `validateSupported(...)`,
  `toMediaStoreSortOrder(...)` (pushes sort into the existing
  `ContentResolver.query`'s `sortOrder` arg for MediaStore-backed
  browsers — cheapest, avoids reading a whole cursor just to re-sort
  it), and `toComparator(...)` (in-memory fallback for SAF/synthetic
  container browsers with no cursor).
- `dc:date` wiring per content type: music already had it (`YEAR`);
  images now attach the already-queried `DATE_TAKEN` to the DIDL item
  (was queried but never wired); video now also queries `DATE_ADDED`;
  SAF files use `DocumentFile.lastModified()`.
- A `SortCriteria` for anything other than `dc:title`/`dc:date` is
  rejected with `UNSUPPORTED_SORT_CRITERIA`, same as malformed syntax.
  Default (no `SortCriteria`) order is unchanged — confirmed via a
  stable-sort argument during review, not just asserted.
- `MAX_SORT_CRITERIA = 8` guards against a resource-exhaustion DoS via
  an arbitrarily long duplicate-criteria chain (added during the
  security-review cycle that initially FAILed on this).

### Known limitations (by design, not bugs)

- Sort mode/direction is global, not remembered per folder.
- Only `dc:title`/`dc:date` are supported — no `upnp:artist`/genre/etc.
  on either side.
- Manual on-device verification against real DLNA servers (the gap
  neither spec could exercise in this sandboxed environment) was done
  by the user directly during development — confirmed working,
  including the server-rejects-sort-criteria fallback path and the
  Date-button-disabled-when-no-dates behavior.
